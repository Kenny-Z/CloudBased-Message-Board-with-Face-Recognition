## IoT Message Board with Face Recognition
Our message board builds an interactive message broadcasting system for the convenience of both the broadcaster and the audience. It uses cloud-based platform Twilio to
send and receive messages and pictures. The local system includes a touchable screen for message display and user interaction, a raspberry pi for computing and controlling,
a local built-in MySQL database to store all the data and a camera for face recognition purposes. Our board provides the function of general announcement, targeted notifica-
tion and 'knock knock'( an interactive broadcasting method). The users are not limited to professors and students, they can be co-workers to bosses in the workplace, parents
to their kids at home and many other possible situations.

## Motivation
In this age of information explosion, its hard for everyone grab the useful info sometimes, and its even harder for the info publisher to target the right info consumers.
This project tries to make the information transfer easier by creating a message board which displays the right information for the right people at the right time.
